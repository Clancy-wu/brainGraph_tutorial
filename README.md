# This is the step-to-step note by running my own data under manual of brainGraph.
# The brainGraph is more recommanded to use in your work than BCT or GRETNA, from myself experience.
# Anyway, I have learned much from the brainGraph, like GLM anlysis, mediation analysis, causal mediation analysis, and some basical information about graph theory. Hope you (someone) can also enjoy it like me.
# This tutorial included my data and code. I have run it successfully in my Windows computer, and I believed it will also work in Linux.
