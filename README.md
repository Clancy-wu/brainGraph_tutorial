This is the step-to-step note by running my own data under manual of brainGraph.

The brainGraph is more recommanded to use in your work than BCT or GRETNA, from myself experience.

Anyway, I have learned much from the brainGraph, like GLM anlysis, mediation analysis, causal mediation analysis, and some basical information about graph theory. Hope you (someone) can also enjoy it like me.

This tutorial included my data and code. I have run it successfully in my Windows computer, and I believed it will also work in Linux.

**Notices:**
1. Here are [some notes](https://editor.csdn.net/md/?articleId=128781466) written by me, but with Chinese lauguage.
2. Here are the [result validations](https://editor.csdn.net/md/?articleId=129985875) between GRETNA (another commonly used software) and brainGraph. The conclusion is that results of both two are **totally same** (much great!), in spite of their different names of multiple network building. Specifically, the "Network Sparsity" in GRETNA responses to "density" in brainGraph, while the "Value of matrix element" in GRETNA responses to "threshold" in brainGraph.
